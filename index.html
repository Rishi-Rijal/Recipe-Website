                <p>
                Heat the oil in a flameproof casserole dish or large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and a generous pinch of salt and fry for 8-10 mins, or until the onion has turned golden brown and sticky. Add the garlic and ginger, cooking for a further minute.
                Chop the chicken into chunky 3cm pieces, add to the pan and fry for 5 mins before stirring through the spice paste and tomatoes, along with 250ml water. Bring to the boil, lower to a simmer and cook on a gentle heat uncovered for 25-30 mins or until rich and slightly reduced. Stir though the yogurt, coriander and ground almonds, season and serve with warm naan or fluffy basmati rice.</p>

                <strong>Step</strong>
                <p>
                To make the tomato sauce, heat the olive oil in a saucepan. Add the onions, garlic and carrot. Cook for 5-7 mins over a medium heat until softened. Turn up the heat a little and stir in the tomato pur√©e. Cook for 1 min, pour in the white wine, then cook for 5 mins until this has reduced by two-thirds. Pour over the chopped tomatoes and add the basil leaves. Bring to the boil then simmer for 20 mins. Leave to cool then whizz in a food processor. Will keep, cooled, in the fridge for up to three days or frozen for three months.

                To make the white sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan, stir in the plain flour, then cook for 2 mins. Slowly whisk in the milk, then bring to the boil, stirring. Turn down the heat, then cook until the sauce starts to thicken and coats the back of a wooden spoon. Will keep, cooled, in the fridge for up to three days or frozen for three months.</p>

                Cut the halloumi into bite-sized cubes and set them aside. Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a large pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and cook for about 5 mins, or until it turns translucent.

                Add the garlic and ginger to the pan. Cook for another 2 mins, stirring frequently, until they become fragrant. Stir in the cumin, coriander and turmeric, and cook for 2 mins more. Pour in the tomatoes and stir well. Simmer for 5-7 mins, or until the mixture thickens.

                Reduce the heat and add the cream. Stir and simmer gently for 3-4 mins until thickened.</p>
